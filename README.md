# Random-List-Anime-Generator

# ONLY WORKS WITH PUBLIC MYANIMELIST ACCOUNTS

# What is this?
* A website where you can enter your MyAnimeList username (or someone else's), filter by list type and it will return to you a random anime from the list.

# Why?
* I am an avid anime watcher and I struggle to find a show to watch (or rewatch) from my list so I decided to make a website that randomly chooses for me.

# How do I use it?
* Enter a MyAnimeList username
* Choose a list status from the list status dropdown
* Choose a format from the format dropdown
* Select a score to filter your results from (**optional**)
